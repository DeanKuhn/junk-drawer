# Welcome to the Junk Drawer!
Here is where I upload all of my side-quest (usually very small) coding projects.

Projects are separated by language.   Each project is time-stamped.

There is also a search bar for easy reference to old code.

Look around!  I'm sure you'll find code that'll need optimization =)
